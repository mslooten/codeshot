# Snippet Shot

This was meant as a simple tool for myself, but I decided to release it publicly anyway. It might benefit someone! It's made as a no-frills tool. The options should be minimal and it should align with my own preferences.

Contributions are welcome, but aware that it should not be a [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) clone. It's familiar but with less options and more opinionated about the resulting look of the code snippet.

So the feature set will remain sparse, but there's a few areas I think we could improve on:

- Storing the last-used settings in localstorage (and retreiving them, obviously)
- Adding a custom watermark image (e.g. a logo or something) on one of 8 positions (left, right, center x top, middle, bottom).
- Doing some more work on cross-browser
- Make the starting background gradient random (or picked from a preselected set of good-looking gradients)
- Make it better on mobile
- Dark mode
- Going over the code and cleaning it up a bit

So plenty to think about!
